# Creating Zoning Maps Using Python & Pandas - Chikondi 

With growing concern over cost of living in the US, as well as gentrification and zoning, more and more people face eviction and an ever growing housing crisis. This lab takes data from the Planned Unit Development (PUD) section (https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/planned-unit-development-puds) of OpenData D.C.(https://opendata.dc.gov/) in order to create a map that display ___ in Washington D.C.. PUD attempts to redistribute benefits of urban redevelopment such as providing affordable housing and improving public transportation. OpenData D.C. is an open source data 
The lab creates a map using Carto, an online mapping and spatial analaysis platform.

The code installs various packages such as Pandas, Geopandas, and Shapely which are used as geo-spatial specific packages.

Shapefiles are used to , concatenate datasets and 

The final output of the code from Google Colab, in conjunction with Carto is a new map that shows 3 different zone categories in Washington D.C. and the location of zoning exempted buildings that provide affordable housing in the city.
