# Creating Zoning Maps Using Python & Pandas - Chikondi 

With growing concern over cost of living in the US, as well as gentrification and zoning, more and more people face eviction and an ever growing housing crisis. This lab takes data from the Planned Unit Development (PUD) section (https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/planned-unit-development-puds) of OpenData D.C.(https://opendata.dc.gov/) in order to create a map that displays the location of zoning exempted buildings that provide affordable housing in Washington D.C.. OpenData D.C. is an open source data that shares governmental data and maps. Specifically, PUD attempts to redistribute benefits of urban redevelopment such as providing affordable housing and improving public transportation. Carto, an online mapping and spatial analaysis platform, is used to create the map in conjunction with the data collected from OpenData D.C. and the Python code.

The code which is written in Google Colab installs various packages such as Pandas, Geopandas, and Shapely which are used as geo-spatial specific packages. Shapefiles are used to , as well as concatenating datasets.

The final output of the code from Google Colab, is a Carto map that shows 3 different zone categories in Washington D.C. and affordable housing units.
